Compiling and Visualizing Stop and Frisk Data in the Charlottesville Region

## About the files

* dataprep: the files in the dataprep folder call the initial data shared from the FOIA requests. We have not provided the initial data here, as three of the four spreadsheets contained addresses which we chose not to release fully at this time.
* data: these files are used in the dashboard, they contain the common fields across the three data sources, including the beat or geographic area in which the stop occurred. These files also contain point data for each stop, but these points are not the actual address reported; they represent a randomly generated point within the same beat. In this way, addressed data is less identifiable. In addition, stops for which an address was reported and stops for which only the beat was reported are represented in the same manner.

The remaining files create the visualizations and dashboard represented at [https://virginiaequitycenter.github.io/cvilleequity_stopandfrisk/](https://virginiaequitycenter.github.io/cvilleequity_stopandfrisk/).
